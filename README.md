# Jax-for-sparse-proximal-multitask-learning
Here are totally five sparse proximal multi-task learning for genome-wide prediction models. These codes are made and compiled using JAX. The other two R language codes are for Bayesian ridge regression and SpikeSlab, which are also used for comparison purpose with sparse proximal multi-task learning for genome-wide prediction models.
All the SPMTL models can be used for parallelized computing (we used five GPUs for accerlating the computational efficiency). They can also work very well without parallel computing. 
Please cite your work when you want to use these projects. Correct citation information is coming soon.
